            <dd>My Name is <i>Divine Mensah.</i> My background is from Ghana but I was born and raised in
                Canada.<br>
                As I grew up, my family taught me how to treat others with respect and show kindness. Throughout<br>
                my
                life I continue to learn new things and the people I have encountered such as teachers and
                friends<br>
                who have taught me things that made me view my life to have a successful career.<br>

            <dd>
                I started my school career at <i>St. Dorothy Catholic School.</i> This was my big first step into
                starting <br>
                my school career. I made many friends and learned lots of life lessons from my teachers that I continue
                <br>
                to carry on till this day. I enjoyed being at this school and made lots of memories. After graduating at
                <br>
                St. Dorothy, I went to Father Henry Carry for Highschool.

            <dd>Highschool was my next step during my school career. Although my first year was during covid, I was
                still <br>
                able to have an enjoyable year. Over the next 3 year was when covid restrictions were lifted, it made my
                Highschool <br>
                experience even better and I began to learn more and meet new teachers and friends during my Highschool
                years. <br>
                <i>Father Henry Carr</i> is a school I will also never forget, it was a wonderful experience.

            <dd>
                My goal is to find something I enjoy doing as a job within the technical field. <br>
                I mostly use only the computer during my freetime. Since I was little, I always <br>
                enjoyed using the computer. I liked how the software functioned as it was being <br>
                ran by code in the background. Everything about the software in the computer is <br>
                fascinating. As I grew, I decided that I may want have a career in Computer Programming <br>
                or CyberSecurity.

                This short video I choose is a motivational video that I keep for myself. It reminds <br>
                me to never give up and to always keep pushing forward even if things may not go my <br>
                way. This is someone who I also admire as he is the one who keeps my hopes and dreams <br>
                to building a successful career.
